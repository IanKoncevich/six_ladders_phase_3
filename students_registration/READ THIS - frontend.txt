Hi!

We have 

- form_one
- form_two
- form_three
- form_four 

with modified css Layout - so it was changed by new css link connection.
This folder css - main.less/css is modified (mostly display none) for the objects what we dont need.

So mainly - just use this local (this folder) css -> main.css file to see the changes.

Best wishes, Yan!
